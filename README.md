# Tomato Leaf Disease Classification

This project aims to classify **Tomato Leaf Diseases** using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on a dataset containing images of tomato leaves affected by various diseases, enabling it to predict the disease type accurately. The dataset is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village).
